<p>Abstract{\textemdash} A robust robot perception system intended to~enable object manipulation needs to be able to accurately~identify objects and their pose at high speeds. Since objects vary~considerably in surface properties, rigidity and articulation, no~single detector or object estimation method has been shown~to provide reliable detection across object types to date. This~indicates the need for an architecture that is able to quickly~swap detectors, pose estimators, and filters, or to run them in~parallel or serial and combine their results, preferably without~any code modifications at all. In this paper, we present our~implementation of such an infrastructure, ReIn (REcognition~INfrastructure), to answer these needs. ReIn is able to combine~a multitude of 2D/3D object recognition and pose estimation~techniques in parallel as dynamically loadable plugins. It also~provides an extremely efficient data passing architecture, and~offers the possibility to change the parameters and initial~settings of these techniques during their execution. In the course~of this work we introduce two new classifiers designed for robot~perception needs: BiGGPy (Binarized Gradient Grid Pyramids)~for scalable 2D classification and VFH (Viewpoint Feature~Histograms) for 3D classification and pose. We then show how~these two classifiers can be easily combined using ReIn to solve~object recognition and pose identification problems.~</p>

<p>We present a novel algorithm for estimating the~orientation of objects from 3D point cloud data. Pose estimation~(of which obtaining the orientation is typically the hardest part)~is extremely relevant for robots performing mobile manipulation~tasks{\textemdash}in order to grasp an object, the robot must know how~the object is situated in space. Our method uses informative local~surface features that capture the geometry accurately to vote for~object orientation. While the geometry of an individual surface~feature may not uniquely determine the object{\textquoteright}s orientation,~it can often provide enough information to constrain the set~of possible orientations, so that combining many such (soft)~constraints can lead to a correct orientation estimate. At each~local feature we attach a local coordinate system, and the space~of all possible orientation estimates is encoded using probability~distributions called Bingham Mixture Models (BMMs) on the~4D hypersphere of unit quaternions, which correctly capture the~topology of the 3D rotational space.</p>
<p>Our algorithm is robust to changes in visual appearance (color,~texture, lighting), as well as occlusions. Unlike previous voting~methods, such as the generalized Hough transform or geometric~hashing, our method uses probabilistic inference of BMMs to~compute a parametric posterior distribution over object poses.~It is therefore extremely fast, since no search of parameter space~is required.</p>

<p>We present a novel method for solving the challenging~problem of generating 3D models of generic object categories from just one single un-calibrated image. Our~method leverages the algorithm proposed in [44] which~enables a partial reconstruction of the object from a single view. A full reconstruction is achieved in an object~completion stage where modified or state-of-the-art 3D~shape and texture completions techniques are used to recover the complete 3D model. We present results of our~method on a number of images containing objects from five~generic categories (mice, staplers, mugs, cars, and bicycles). We demonstrate (numerically and quantitatively) that~our method produces convincing 3D models from a single~image using minimal or no human intervention. Our technique is targeted to applications where users are interested~in building virtual collections of 3D models of objects, and~sharing such models in virtual environments such as Google~3D Warehouse or Second Life (secondlife.com).</p>

To effectively train robot algorithms for such scenarios, a large amount of training data containing both people and the environment is required. Collecting such data involves taking a robot into new environments,~ observing and interacting with people. So far, best practices for robot data collection have been undefined. Fortunately, the human-robot interaction community has conducted field studies whose methodology can serve as a model. In this paper, we draw parallels between field study observation and the data collection process, suggesting that best practices may be transferable.

The sensors must be calibrated both to the manipulators and to each other, since fused sensor data is often needed. We propose an extendable framework that combines measurements from the robot{\textquoteright}s various sensors (proprioceptive and external) to calibrate the robot{\textquoteright}s joint offsets and external sensor locations. Our approach is unique in that it accounts for sensor measurement uncertainties, thereby allowing sensors with very different error characteristics to be used side by side in the calibration. The framework is general enough to handle complex robots with kinematic components, including external sensors on kinematic chains. We validate the framework by implementing it on the Willow Garage PR2 robot, providing a significant improvement in the robot{\textquoteright}s calibration.</p>},

	abstract = {             Detecting objects, estimating their pose and recovering 3D
shape information is a critical problem in many vision and robotics ap-
plications. This paper addresses the above needs by proposing a new
method called DEHV - Depth-Encoded Hough Voting detection scheme.
Inspired by the Hough voting scheme introduced in [13], DEHV incor-
porates depth information into the process of learning distributions of
image features (patches) representing an object category. DEHV takes
advantage of the interplay between the scale of each object patch in the
image and its distance (depth) from the corresponding physical patch
attached to the 3D object. In training, we use various views of an object
using a 2D image and its associated depth map (which we assume is avail-
able in learning). In testing, DEHV jointly detects objects, infers their
categories, estimates their pose, and infers/decodes objects depth maps
from either a single image (when no depth maps are available in testing)
or a single image augmented with depth map (when this is available in
testing). Extensive quantitative and qualitative experimental analysis on
existing datasets [6,9,22] and a newly proposed 3D table-top object cat-
egory dataset shows that our DEHV scheme obtains competitive detec-
tion and pose estimation results on all the dataset. Most importantly, we
demonstrate (with quantitative and qualitative evaluation) that DEHV
is capable to reconstruct the 3D shape of the object from just one single
uncalibrated image. Finally, we demonstrate that our technique can be
successfully employed as a key building block in two application scenar-
ios (highly accurate 6 degree of freedom (6 DOF) pose estimation and
3D object modeling).

	abstract = {<p>Service robots deployed in domestic environments<br />generally need the capability to deal with articulated objects such as doors and drawers in order to fulfill certain mobile manipulation tasks. This however, requires, that the robots are able to perceive articulated furniture objects such as cupboards, dishwashers and cabinets. In this paper, we present an approach for detecting, tracking, and learning 3D articulation models for doors and drawers without using arti?cial markers. Our approach uses a highly efficient and sampling-based approach to rectangle detection in dense depth images obtained from a self-developed projected texture stereo vision system. The robot can use the generative models learned for the articulated objects to estimate their mechanism type, their current configuration, and to predict their opening trajectory. In our experiments we demonstrate that (1) we obtain dense depth images in the workspace of our robot using our camera system, (2) we are able to robustly and reliably detect cabinet fronts from depth<br />images, and (3) are able to learn accurate articulation models for the observed articulated objects. We furthermore provide a detailed error analysis based on ground truth data obtained in a motion capturing studio.</p>},

To create models<br />suitable for grasping, we extract the supporting planes and<br />model object clusters with different surface geometric primi-<br />tives.

To<br />annotate the point cloud data with primitive geometric labels<br />we make use of our previously proposed Fast Point Feature<br />Histograms [2] and probabilistic graphical methods (Condi-<br />tional Random Fields), and obtain a classification accuracy of<br />98.27\% for different object geometries.

We implement our method using a novel LDA-<br />SIFT formulation which performs LDA prior to any vector quantization step; we<br />discover latent topics which are characteristic of particular transparent patches and<br />quantize the SIFT space into transparent visual words according to the latent topic<br />dimensions.

In particular, we segment the parts of interest using robust geometric estimators and statistical methods applied on geometric and intensity distribution variations in the scan. We present experimental results on a mobile manipulation platform (PR2) intended for indoor manipulation tasks. We validate the approach by generating trajectories that position the robot end-effector in front of door handles and grasp the handle. The robustness of our approach is demonstrated by real world experiments conducted on a large set of doors.</p>},

In this paper, we modify their mathematical expressions and perform a rigorous analysis on their robustness and complexity for the problem of 3D registration for overlapping point cloud views. More concretely, we present several optimizations that reduce their computation times drastically by either caching previously computed values or by revising their theoretical formulations. The latter results in a new type of local features, called Fast Point Feature Histograms (FPFH), which retain most of the discriminative power of the PFH. Moreover, we propose an algorithm for the online computation of FPFH features for realtime applications. To validate our results we demonstrate their efficiency for 3D registration and propose a new sample consensus based method for bringing two datasets into the convergence basin of a local non-linear optimizer: SAC-IA (SAmple Consensus Initial Alignment).</p>},

Given an unorganized 3D point cloud, our algorithm recreates the underlying surface{\textquoteright}s geometrical properties using data resampling and a robust triangulation algorithm in near realtime. For resulting smooth surfaces, the data is resampled with variable densities according to previously estimated surface curvatures. Incremental scans are easily incorporated into an existing surface mesh, by determining the respective overlapping area and reconstructing only the updated part of the surface mesh. The proposed framework is flexible enough to be integrated with additional point label information, where groups of points sharing the same label are clustered together and can be reconstructed separately, thus allowing fast updates via triangular mesh decoupling. To validate our approach, we present results obtained from laser scans acquired in both indoor and outdoor environments.</p>},

To show the validity of our approach, we analyze the proposed system for the<br />problem of recognizing the object class of 20 objects in 500 table settings<br />scenarios.~ Our algorithm identifies the planar surfaces, decomposes the scene<br />and objects into geometric primitives with 98.27\% accuracy and uses the<br />geometric primitives to identify the object{\textquoteright}s class with an accuracy of 96.69\%.</p>},

results of this paper will show this method yields a RMS 0.25 m

	abstract = {<p>This paper describes {"Little} Ben," an autonomous ground vehicle constructed by the Ben Franklin Racing Team for the 2007 {DARPA} Urban Challenge in under a year and for less than \$250,000. The sensing, planning, navigation, and actuation systems for Little Ben were carefully designed to meet the performance demands required of an autonomous vehicle traveling in an uncertain urban environment. We incorporated an array of a global positioning system {(GPS)-inertial} navigation system, {LIDARs,} and stereo cameras to provide timely information about the surrounding environment at the appropriate ranges. This sensor information was integrated into a dynamic map that could robustly handle {GPS} dropouts and errors. Our planning algorithms consisted of a high-level mission planner that used information from the provided route network definition and mission data files to select routes, whereas the lower level planner used the latest dynamic map information to optimize a feasible trajectory to the next waypoint. The vehicle was actuated by a cost-based controller that efficiently handled steering, throttle, and braking maneuvers in both forward and reverse directions. Our software modules were integrated within a hierarchical architecture that allowed rapid development and testing of the system performance. The resulting vehicle was one of six to successfully finish the Urban Challenge.</p>},

<p>Human object recognition in a physical 3-d envronment is still far superior to that of any robotic vision system.~We believe that one reason (out of many) for this{\textemdash}one that has not heretofore been significantly exploited in the~artificial vision literature{\textemdash}is that humans use a fovea to fixate on, or near an object, thus obtaining a very high~resolution image of the object and rendering it easy to recognize. In this paper, we present a novel method for~identifying and tracking objects in multi-resolution digital video of partially cluttered environments. Our method~is motivated by biological vision systems and uses a learned {\textquotedblleft}attentive{\textquotedblright} interest map on a low resolution data stream~to direct a high resolution {\textquotedblleft}fovea.{\textquotedblright} Objects that are recognized in the fovea can then be tracked using peripheral~vision. Because object recognition is run only on a small foveal image, our system achieves performance in real-time~object recognition and tracking that is well beyond simpler systems.</p>

	abstract = {We present a method for identifying drivable surfaces in difficult unpaved and offroad terrain conditions as
encountered in the DARPA Grand Challenge robot race. Instead
of relying on a static, pre-computed road appearance model, this
method adjusts its model to changing environments. It achieves
robustness by combining sensor information from a laser range
finder, a pose estimation system and a color camera. Using the
first two modalities, the system first identifies a nearby patch
of drivable surface. Computer Vision then takes this patch and
uses it to construct appearance models to find drivable surface
outward into the far range. This information is put into a
drivability map for the vehicle path planner. In addition to
evaluating the method{\textquoteright}s performance using a scoring framework
run on real-world data, the system was entered, and won, the
2005 DARPA Grand Challenge. Post-race log-file analysis proved
that without the Computer Vision algorithm, the vehicle would
not have driven fast enough to win.

	abstract = {<p>We are at the beginning of the multicore era. Computers will have increasingly<br />many cores (processors), but there is still no good programming framework for<br />these architectures, and thus no simple and unified way for machine learning to<br />take advantage of the potential speed up. In this paper, we develop a broadly ap-<br />plicable parallel programming method, one that is easily applied to many different<br />learning algorithms. Our work is in distinct contrast to the tradition in machine<br />learning of designing (often ingenious) ways to speed up a single algorithm at a<br />time. Specifically, we show that algorithms that fit the Statistical Query model [15]<br />can be written in a certain {\textquotedblleft}summation form,{\textquotedblright} which allows them to be easily par-<br />allelized on multicore computers. We adapt Google{\textquoteright}s map-reduce [7] paradigm to<br />demonstrate this parallel speed up technique on a variety of learning algorithms<br />including locally weighted linear regression (LWLR), k-means, logistic regres-<br />sion (LR), naive Bayes (NB), SVM, ICA, PCA, gaussian discriminant analysis<br />(GDA), EM, and backpropagation (NN). Our experimental results show basically<br />linear speedup with an increasing number of processors.</p>},

	abstract = {The rapid expansion of computer processing power combined with the rapid development of digital camera capability has resulted in equally rapid advances in computer vision capability and use. Intel has long been at the forefront of enabling this advance on the computer hardware and software side. Computer vision software is supported by the free Open Source Computer Vision Library (OpenCV) that optionally may be highly optimized by loading the commercial Intel Integrated Performance Primitives (IPP). IPP now automatically supports OpenCV with no need to change or even recompile the user{\textquoteright}s source code. This functionality enables development groups to deploy vision and provides basic infrastructure to experts in vision.

OpenCV has long supported {\textquotedblleft}geometric vision{\textquotedblright} from camera calibration, motion tracking in 2D, finding the camera location given a known 3D object, on up to producing depth maps from stereo vision. This paper describes using OpenCV for {\textquotedblleft}learning-based vision,{\textquotedblright} where objects such as faces, or patterns such as roads, are learned for segmentation and recognition.               },

tion tools are introduced that can activate a binary switch
and issue a selection command. {\textquotedblleft}BlinkLink,{\textquotedblright} as the
first tool is called, automatically detects a user{\textquoteright}s eye
blinks and accurately measures their durations. The sys-
tem is intended to provide an alternate input modality
to allow people with severe disabilities to access a com-
puter. Voluntary long blinks trigger mouse clicks, while
involuntary short blinks are ignored. The system enables
communication using {\textquotedblleft}blink patterns:{\textquotedblright} sequences of long
and short blinks which are interpreted as semiotic mes-
sages. The second tool, {\textquotedblleft}EyebrowClicker,{\textquotedblright} automat-
ically detects when a user raises his or her eyebrows and
then triggers a mouse click. Both systems can initial-
ize themselves, track the eyes at frame rate, and recover
in the event of errors. No special lighting is required.
The systems have been tested with interactive games and
a spelling program. Results demonstrate overall detec-
tion accuracy of 95.6\% for BlinkLink and 89.0\% for Eye-
browClicker.

	abstract = {A method for a real-time vision system that automatically detects a user{\textquoteright}s eye blinks and accurately measures their durations i sintroduced. The system is intended to provide an alternate input modality to allow people with severe disabilities to access a computer. Voluntary long blinks trigger mouse clicks, while involuntary short blinks are ignored. The system enables communications use "blink patterns:" sequences of long and short blinks which are interpreted as semiotic messages. The location of the eyes is determined automatically through th emotion of the user{\textquoteright}s initial blinks. Subsequently, the eye is tracked by correlation across time, and appearance changes are automatically analyzed in order to classify the eye as either open or closed at each frame. No manual initialization, special lighting, or prior face detection is required. The system has been tested with interactive games and a spelling program. Results demonstrate overall detection of 95.6\% and an average rate of 28 frames per second. },
